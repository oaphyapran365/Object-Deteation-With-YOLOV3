# Object-Deteation-With-YOLOV3
YOLOv3 is a faster object detection algorithm in computer vision and first described by Joseph Redmon, Santosh Divvala, Ross Girshick and Ali Farhadi in 'You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection'

This notebook implements an object detection based on a pre-trained model - YOLOv3 Pre-trained Weights (yolov3.weights) (237 MB). The model architecture is called a “DarkNet” and was originally loosely based on the VGG-16 model.
